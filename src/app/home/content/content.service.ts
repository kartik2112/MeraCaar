            explanation: 'The disc brake is a lot like the brakes on a bicycle. Bicycle brakes have a caliper, which squeezes the brake pads against the wheel. In a disc brake, the brake pads squeeze the rotor instead of the wheel, and the force is transmitted hydraulically instead of through a cable. Friction between the pads and the disc slows the disc down.\
            <br/>A moving car has a certain amount of kinetic energy, and the brakes have to remove this energy from the car in order to stop it. How do the brakes do this? Each time you stop your car, your brakes convert the kinetic energy to heat generated by the friction between the pads and the disc. Most car disc brakes are vented.',

            explanation: '<h5>Tyre components</h5>\
            <h6>A. Tire Belts</h6>\
            Rubber-coated layers of steel, fiberglass, rayon, and other materials located between the tread and plies, crisscrossing at angles, hold the plies in place. Belts provide resistance to punctures and help treads stay flat and in contact with the road. \
            <h6>B. Tire Sipes</h6>\
            Sipes are special treads within the tread that improve traction on wet, dirty, sandy, or snowy road surfaces. \
            <h6>C. Tire Tread</h6>\
            The portion of the tire that comes in contact with the road. \
            <h6>D. Tire Grooves</h6>\
            The spaces between two adjacent tread ribs are also called tread grooves. These allow water to escape effectively. \
            <h6>E. Tire Shoulder</h6>\
            The outer edge of the tread that wraps into the sidewall area.\
            <h6>F. Tire Sidewall</h6>\
            The sidewall of the tire protects cord plies and features tire markings and information such as tire size and type.\
            <h6>G. Tire Inner Liner</h6>\
            This is the innermost layer of a tubeless tire that prevents air from penetrating the tire. \
            <h6>H. Tire Bead</h6>\
            A rubber-coated loop of high-strength steel cable that allows a tire to stay "seated" on a rim.\
            <h6>I. Tire Body Plies</h6>\
            This is the tire itself, made up of several layers of plies. Plies, like polyester cord, run perpendicular to the tire\'s tread and are coated with rubber to help bond with other plies and belts to seal in air. Plies give tires strength and resistance to road damage.\

            explanation: '<h5>Step 1: Intake Stroke</h5>\
				Air and fuel enter the small engine through the carburetor. It’s the job of the carburetor to supply a mixture of air and fuel that will allow for proper combustion. During the intake stroke, the intake valve between the carburetor and combustion chamber opens. This allows atmospheric pressure to force the air-fuel mixture into the cylinder bore as the piston moves downward.\
				<h5>Step 2: Compression Stroke</h5>\
				Just after the piston moves to the bottom of its travel (bottom dead center), the cylinder bore contains the maximum air-fuel mixture possible. The intake valve closes and the piston returns back up the cylinder bore. This is called the compression stroke of the 4-cycle engine process. The air-fuel mixture is compressed between the piston and cylinder head.\
				<h5>Step 3: Power Stroke</h5>\
				When the piston reaches the top of its travel (top dead center), it will be at its optimum point to ignite the fuel to get maximize power to your outdoor power equipment. A very high voltage is created in the ignition coil. The spark plug enables this high voltage to be discharged into the combustion chamber. The heat created by the spark ignites the gases, creating rapidly expanding, super-heated gases that force the piston back down the cylinder bore. This is called the power stroke.\
				<h5>Step 4: Exhaust Stroke</h5>\
				When the piston reaches bottom dead center again, the exhaust valve opens. As the piston travels back up the cylinder bore, it forces the spent combustion gases through the exhaust valve and out of the exhaust systems. As the piston returns to top dead center, the exhaust valve closes and the intake valve opens and the 4-cycle engine process repeat.\
				Ever repetition of the cycle requires two full rotations of the crankshaft, while the engine only creates power during one of the four strokes. To keep the machine running, it needs the small engine flywheel. The power stroke creates momentum that pushes the flywheel’s inertia keeps it and the crankshaft turning during the exhaust, intake and compression strokes.',

            explanation: 'For the non-driven wheels on your car -- the front wheels on a rear-wheel drive car, \
            the back wheels on a front-wheel drive car -- this is not an issue. There is no connection between them, \
            so they spin independently. But the driven wheels are linked together so that a single engine and transmission can turn both wheels. \
            If your car did not have a differential, the wheels would have to be locked together, forced to spin at the same speed. \
            This would make turning difficult and hard on your car: For the car to be able to turn, one tire would have to slip. \
            With modern tires and concrete roads, a great deal of force is required to make a tire slip. \
            That force would have to be transmitted through the axle from one wheel to another, putting a heavy strain on the axle components.\
            <h5>Parts of a Differential</h5>\
            We will now learn how the differential achieves this in a step-by-step manner using the simplest configuration. \
            Power from the engine is transferred to the ring gear through a pinion gear. The ring gear is connected to a spider gear.\
            The spider gear lies at the heart of the differential, and special mention should be made about its rotation. The spider gear is free to make 2 kinds of rotations: one along with the ring gear (rotation) and the second on its own axis (spin).\
            The spider gear is meshed with 2 side gears. You can see that both the spider and side gears are bevel gears. Power flow from the drive shaft to the drive wheels follows the following pattern. \
            From the drive shaft power is transferred to the pinion gear first, and since the pinion and ring gear are meshed, power flows to the ring gear. \
            As the spider gear is connected with the ring gear, power flows to it. \
            Finally from the spider gear, power gets transferred to both the side gears.',

            explanation: 'Now back to the initial problem. Since one wheel is on a high traction surface, the torque transmitted to it will be higher. \
            So the thrust force developed due to the bevel gear separation action also will be high at that side. \
            Thus clutch pack at high traction wheel side will be pressed firmly and clutch pack will be locked. \
            So power from the differential casing will flow directly to high traction axle via clutch pack assembly.\
            On the other hand clutch pack on the low traction wheel side is not engaged yet, so power flow will be limited to that side. \
            So the vehicle will be able to overcome the traction difference problem.\
            However while taking a turn the LSD can act like a normal differential. \
            In this case thrust force developed due to bevel gear separation action won’t be that high. \
            So the plates in clutch pack will easily overcome frictional resistance and will be able to slip against each other. \
            Thus the right and left wheel can have different speed just like an open differential.',

            It works efficiently only when the pistons in the cylinders are pumping up and down at high speeds—about 10-20 times a second. \
            Even when the car is simply idling by the roadside, the pistons still need to push up and down roughly 1000 times a minute or the engine will cut out. \
            In other words, the engine has a minimum speed at which it works best of about 1000 rpm. \
            But that creates an immediate problem because if the engine were connected directly to the wheels, \
            they\'d have a minimum speed of 1000rpm as well—which corresponds to roughly 120km/h or 75mph. \
            Put it another way, if you switched on the ignition in a car like this, your wheels would instantly turn at 75mph! \
            Suppose you put your foot down until the rev counter reached 7000 rpm. Now the wheels should be turning round \
            about seven times faster and you\'d be going at 840 km/h or about 525 mph\!\
            It sounds wildly exciting, but there\'s a snag. \
            It takes a massive amount of force to get a car moving from a standstill and an engine that tries to go at top speed, \
            right from the word go, won\'t generate enough force to do it. That\'s why cars need gearboxes. \
            To begin with, a car needs a huge amount of force and very little speed to get it moving, so the driver uses a low gear. \
            In effect, the gearbox is reducing the speed of the engine greatly but increasing its force in the same proportion to get the car moving. \
            Once the car\'s going, the driver switches to a higher gear. More of the engine\'s power switches to making speed—and the car goes faster.',

            <h5>SPRINGS</h5>\
            There are three types of spring – coil springs, leaf springs and torsion bars.\
            Most modern cars have coil springs, while older cars and many four-wheel drive vehicles have leaf springs, \
            which are layers of metal connected to the axle that flex under the weight of the car.\
            <h5>DAMPERS (SHOCK ABSORBERS)</h5>\
            Dampers, commonly known as shock absorbers, protect the chassis from the jarring force caused when a wheel hits a bump and prevents the springs from continually bouncing. \
            They also push the wheel back to the road surface.\
            A damper is a piston filled with oil that separates the chassis from the wheel. \
            When the car hits a bump the piston pushes into the casing and is slowed by the oil, which flows into another chamber as it’s compressed.',
